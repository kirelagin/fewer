# Fewer

_Sometimes fewer is better._

This is a minimalistic watch face on a simple black backdrop.

* Straightforward 24-hour clock.
* Date in the only true [ISO 8601 format][xkcd:iso8601].
* The battery indicator shows remaining charge,
  becomes red when the battery is too low,
  and becomes green when charging is almost finished.
* Steps counter.
* Heart rate.
* Just dimmed time in AOD.

## Insallation

* On your phone, open [galaxy.store/few][store:few] in your browser
  or simply search for “Fewer” in the Galaxy Store.
* Install.

## Contributing

If you encounter any issues when using this watch face or have improvement ideas,
please open report in issue on GitHub.

Unfortunately, the `.fwd` format appears to be binary, and I have no idea how
to turn it into something more readable, so doing version control on it is
tricky. For this reason, I’m not really sure how to handle PRs, if you open one.
